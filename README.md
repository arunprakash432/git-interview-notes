## About this repo

Many software/engineering roles now expect familiarity with Git: how it works, when and why to use specific commands, handling branching & merging, conflict resolution, workflows in teams, and even Git internals.  
These interview notes collect essential Git topics in one place for easy reference.

### Topics Covered

- What is Git and how it differs from other version control systems  
- Basic commands: `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`  
- Branching and merging strategies (`git branch`, `git merge`, `git rebase`)  
- Remote repositories, workflows, and collaboration (`git fetch`, `git pull`, `git push`)  
- Conflict resolution, rebasing, and maintaining clean commit history  
- Advanced features: `git stash`, `git cherry-pick`  
- Quick reference commands and best practices  

## How to use these notes

- Browse through the files and pick topics you’re less familiar with.  
- Use the commands and examples practically by working in a Git repo — hands-on practice helps retention.  
- For interview prep: review each command & concept, and think of real scenarios where you used or could use them.  
- Keep the quick-reference handy for last-minute revision.  
- If you find any missing topic or want to deepen one section, you’re encouraged to contribute (see below).
